### Command Format
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the attributes to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a attribute which can be used as `add n/John Doe`, `n/` is its attribute prefix.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items in with `|` are valid inputs.<br>
  e.g `t/volunteer|beneficiary` can be used as `t/volunteer` or as `t/beneficiary`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Attributes can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous attributes for commands that do not take in attributes (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## FAQ
**Q**: Where are my data files stored?<br>
**A**: In a folder named `data` in the same directory of `addressbook.jar`, you can find the data file named `addressbook.json`.
Data is only stored locally, saved automatically whenever commands that modify data are executed.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file (`addressbook.json`) it creates with the original data file.
If the data folder does not exist yet, you can simply copy over the entire `data` folder from your previous AddressBook home folder.

**Q**: What do I do if the command box says "Unknown command"?<br>
**A**: This means that the command you entered is not recognized by the application. Please ensure that you have typed the command correctly according to the formats specified in this user guide. You can type `help` to view the help window for reference.

## :warning:Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
